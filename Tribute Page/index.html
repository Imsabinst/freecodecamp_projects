          "While recording song for Dakshina, Gopal was talking and joking with
          the music director when the director said "Why don't we order some ice
          cream" then he said to another musician, another musician declined the
          offer since it would mess up their voice than director came to Gopal
          and said why don't we order 1 kg ice cream than Gopal said yes that's
          a good idea. After ordering the ice cream he gave to Gopal than Gopal
          started eating another person in the studio said "Is he crazy, if he
          eats the ice cream it will mess up his voice" then Gopal came into the
          studio he sang a song without any retakes, after singing he had gotten
          cold from the ice cream. Later the director asked to play the song,
          which sounded amazing."
